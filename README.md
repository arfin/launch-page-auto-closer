This extension will automatically close your launch tabs for Asana, Zoom, and Slack when opening the respective desktop apps and restore focus to the tab you were on beforehand. You can change the countdown time by clicking one of the offered alternate times. This is a fork of this [Zoom closing extension](https://github.com/ChromeAdmin/meetings-page-auto-closer-for-zoom).

Installation instrcutions:
1. Download the source code by clicking "code" (green button) -> "download ZIP"
2. Unpack the Zip
3. Navigate to chrome://extensions
4. Toggle "developer mode" in the top right
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder
6. Profit!

PRs welcome!
Wishlist:
- More granular URL targeting

NB(avi): I don't have Asana github access yet so this is just in my personal Github for now.
When I get access, I'll plan to copy the project over so it's more maintainable.
